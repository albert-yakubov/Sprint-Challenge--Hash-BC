Given a package with a weight limit `limit` and a list `weights` of item weights, 
implement a function `get_indices_of_item_weights` 
that finds two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit `limit`. 
Your function will return an instance of an `Answer` tuple that has the following form:
```
(zero, one)
```
where each element represents the item weights of the two packages. 
_**The higher valued index should be placed in the `zeroth` index 
and the smaller index should be placed in the `first` index.
**_ If such a pair doesnâ€™t exist for the given inputs, your function should return `None`.

_NOTE:_ When calling `hash_table_retrieve` with a key that doesn't exist in the hash table,
 `hash_table_retrieve` will return `None`.
